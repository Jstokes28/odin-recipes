    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> A beet based dish with as many variations as there are stories of its origin.</p>
    <p> The roots of the dish are contested between Slavic countries. Traditionally served with bread. In Ukraine, this
        is generally garlicky and in roll form - but while I CAN make bread, I generally eat it as-is. It's also traditionally made with meat,
    but I'm too lazy to cook ground meat more than I have to. Mine is vegetarian, and if you make it without the sour cream, it becomes a lovely light (and vegan!) soup. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Beets </li>
        <li> Potatoes, if desired </li>
        <li> Stock - I use beef, usually </li>
        <li> Sour cream for garnish /li>
        <li> Carrots </li>
        <li> Cabbage </li>
        <li> Pretty much whatever vegetables you have on hand </li>
        <li> Lemon juice </li>
        <li> Dill </li>
        <li> Oil to add with the stock </li>
       
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> You ready for this? Really, it's easy. Simplest soup. </li>
        <li> Add a load of stock to the pot </li>
        <li> Add the beets </li>
        <li> Add the potatoes - if desired. They can make your soup cloudy. </li>
        <li> Add your carrots </li>
        <li> Bubble away at it at whatever heat you like until the potatoes or carrots or beets are cooked through </li>
        <li> This is even easier if you grate the beets in question! </li>
        <li> Toss in a bunch of dill - as much as you like </li>
        <li> To up the acidity, add lemon juice </li>
        <li> Add a bunch of salt and a bunch of pepper </li>
        <li> Serve with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkling of dill </li>
        <li> Be careful to not splash it - borscht is a professional stainer. </li>
    </ol>
