# odin-recipes
Recipes project from Odin
Trying to learn along with the Odin Project now. I think it might wind up a bit more real-world than freeCodeCamp, which is nice, but I'm nervous about getting in over my head.

I anticipate using HTML here, according to the description of the finished project as 'Brutalist'. I might come back to it later on my own time.

Also: 'code .' when inside a file in the command line makes me feel like a coding MASTERMIND.
